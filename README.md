# Orienteering app
Orienteering is an originally swedish sport where you go around to different stations, also called "controls", in which you stamp with a physical stamp on a control card. The person who does the controls in the fastest fashion wins. This is an application in a course on KTH with the purpose of digitizing the process.

## Starting the application
1. Download and install [Evothings studio](https://evothings.com/download/)
2. Drag the index.html into the program.
3. Connect your phone to Evothings.
4. Click the run button on the "My Apps" tab on the "Orienteering" project.
5. You are probably now running the app on your phone! :D
